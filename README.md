## 📖 Overview

**That Time I Generated a Grid on My Image** is a lightweight, client-side utility designed for artists, developers, and designers who need pixel-perfect reference grids.

Unlike other tools that require server uploads or heavy software installations, this application runs entirely within your web browser using the **HTML5 Canvas API**. This ensures zero latency and guarantees that your images never leave your device.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🔒 Privacy-First Architecture:** 100% client-side execution. Your photos are processed in memory and never uploaded to a server.
* **🎨 Fully Customizable:**
    * Adjust **Rows (Y)** and **Columns (X)** dynamically.
    * Native **Color Picker** to ensure grid visibility against any background.
* **🌗 Adaptive Theming:** Persistent **Dark/Light mode** that respects your system preferences and saves your choice.
* **💾 High-Quality Export:** Download your gridded images instantly in PNG format.
